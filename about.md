My name is Justin Hong, a full-stack software engineer currently based in Los Angeles. I’m actively tweaking this website, having just moved it over from an automatically-generated GitHub Pages site to one whose source has proper Jekyll and Octopress underpinnings.

I’ll be writing about my struggles, accomplishments, and general thoughts regarding web development. I plan on getting out of this default Jekyll theme as well. Exciting!
